Ant Junit Result Formatter
==========================

The primary reference for the schema was the 
[ANT source for XMLJUnitResultFormatter](http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ant/core/trunk/src/main/org/apache/tools/ant/taskdefs/optional/junit/XMLJUnitResultFormatter.java)
which was found via the
[StackOverflow question about the spec for junit xml output](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/442556/spec-for-junit-xml-output)
which had no satisfying complete answers.

I also found the
[proposal for enhancing Ant's test reports](http://wiki.apache.org/ant/Proposals/EnhancedTestReports)
but that does not describe it.
